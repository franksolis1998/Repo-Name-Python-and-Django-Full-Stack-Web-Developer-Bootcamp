        <h1>Welcome to your First Excersie!!</h1>
        <p>For this Excercise we will be creating a weight metric converter
        <p>We will take in a number in pounds (lbs) and convert it to kilograms (kg). Right now we only know enough to do this one way, but later on we will learn how to add logic to this sort of problem!
        </p>
        <p> To complete this excersice do the following
        <ul>
            <li>Link the HTML file (Part3_Excersice.html) to your own .js file</li>
            <li>Use JavaScript to accept a number of input in pounds (lbs)</li>
            <li>Then in your js file convert this to kilograms(*0.454)</li>
            <li>Afterwards report back in an alert the weight is in kg</li>
            <li>Then log/write "Conversation Completed" to the console</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
